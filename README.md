# mal-flv

`mal-flv` is a simple Chromium extension (works in any chromium-based browser such as Chrome or Edge) which performs webscrapping on `myanimelist.net` to determine the currently browsed anime and find (or try to find) the respective AnimeFLV page.

## why?

i just found very boring and nonsense to manually search for the anime episodes on google. this way, i only need to click one button and the extension will look for the episodios for me.

## how does it work?

chromium embeds a little script on `myanimelist.net` which is able to extract the anime title from the webpage and try to guess the AnimeFLV link with their api.
